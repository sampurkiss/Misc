    "Trump's latest call with a world leader has given everyone a case of impeachment fever. The summarized transcript has been released and it's fairly easy to see why impeachment is likely inevitable. However, people are worked up about what may be missing from the transcript. One senator suggested after a readout of the transcripts that 20 minutes of conversation might be missing ([link](https://www.newsweek.com/senator-king-suggests-least-20-minutes-are-missing-trump-ukraine-call-transcript-1462622)). However, I think the only thing that's missing is time allowance for translation which I will show below."

    "Strangely, in the Nieto and Turnbull call, Trump manages to say about 70 words per minute and the other world leaders squeeze in about 60. In the Zelenskyy call, Trump only manages 50 words per minute and Zelenskyy speaks 80. This indicates that, for some reason, Trump spoke 30% less and Zelenskyy spoke 30% more. \n",

    "So, we already know that the the transcript isn't the full transcript. We know it's been edited down somehow. My main question is, did Trump really speak a lot less? Did Zelenskyy really speak a lot more? Or have things been modified to hide one or the other? \n",

    "Next step, I want to translate the English words to get a sense of how many words were actually used. I think King et. al. should use the transcript with translation to see if it still seems like anything is missing. The other thing I hope to do is use sentiment analysis to dig into how each conversation actually went. Unfortunately transcripts between Trump and world leaders are notoriously hard to get (for good reason, probably) so, even though I'd love to run some ML analysis, the training set is a bit too small."
